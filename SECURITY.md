# Security Guide for Solution 360

This document outlines security best practices and configurations for the Solution 360 application.

## Environment Variables

1. **Never commit your .env files to version control**
   - The `.env.example` file is provided as a template
   - Create a `.env` file for local development
   - Set up environment variables in your hosting platform for production

2. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Firebase API keys are not secret but should still be managed via environment variables
   - Restrict your Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Storage with proper security rules
   - Configure proper authentication methods in the Firebase console
   - cgabfess

## Authentication Security

1. **Password Policy**
   - Application enforces strong passwords (min 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters)
   - Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks (5 attempts before timeout)
   - Failed login attempts are tracked and recorded

2. **IP Restrictions**
   - Employees are restricted to login from allowed IP addresses configured in the company settings
   - IP validation is enforced for employee-level accounts only
   - All login attempts are logged with IP address information

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

The application implements a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS and related attacks:

- Scripts are only loaded from trusted sources
- Inline scripts are restricted
- Third-party resources are limited to specific domains
- SRI (Subresource Integrity) is used for external scripts

## Production Deployment Checklist

1. **Environment**
   - Set up all required environment variables
   - Enable HTTPS-only access
   - Configure appropriate CORS settings

2. **Firebase Security**
   - Review and test Firestore security rules
   - Ensure Firebase Authentication is properly configured
   - Set up appropriate Firebase Storage security rules

3. **Monitoring**
   - Enable login monitoring and alerting
   - Review logs periodically for suspicious activity
   - Set up automatic backups of Firestore data

## Security Updates and Maintenance

1. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies to latest secure versions
   - Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
   - Consider implementing automatic dependency updates with security checks

2. **Security Testing**
   - Perform regular security audits
   - Consider automated security scanning
   - Implement proper testing for authentication flows

## Reporting Security Issues
